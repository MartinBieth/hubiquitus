The following is a list of options supported by hubiquitus and an explanation of each one of them.
They can be set as parameters in the command line when launching hubiquitus: `$hubiquitus --topology.path <path>`
or using a config file in the form: `topology.path = /home/path` and adding `--config file.cfg` when launching hubiquitus.

If a value is expected to be an array, use a comma separated list
 
## Topology Path
Path to the topology file, read on start by the launcher  

```
options["topology.path"] = <String>
```

`Default Value: "samples/sample1.json"`
